## How to use 

### To run
install python (my version is 3.9 but should work on any 3.6+)

`py -m pip install bs4` (or your systems equivalent, on mac/linux it is `python3 -m pip install bs4`)
### Cookies
To use this program these two cookies are needed. Open up the console (f12/ctrl-shift-i) and go to applications tab, copy the value in the `cf_clearance` and `ogusersmybbuser` fields

and enter them into the program when asked, only other thing you will need is a discord webhook. Please note, your `ogusersmybbuser` allows people access to your account (from what i know) so make sure you keep this secure and dont run this program anywhere where someone has access to the code. 

This program has been 100% written by me, there is nothing malicious here, if using from a fork of this (if this breaks down the line and someone fixes) i cannot guarentee the same security, either way, i am not responsible for anything
